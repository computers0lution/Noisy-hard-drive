There are several types of sounds that strike fear into users when it comes to their critical data storage. **[Noisy hard drive](https://github.com/computers0lution/Noisy-hard-drive)** when idle and your device isn't writing or retrieving a bunch of files can be a cause for concern. But some abnormal hard drive sounds are more worrying than others, including:

* Buzzing or vibration sounds
* A high-pitched whine
* Repeated regular or rhythmic tapping, grinding, or beeping
* With external drives, clicking or beeping (not from the computer) at the time of connection, especially if it is not being detected properly

In some cases, there may be a combination of these sounds, which we will detail below where they most commonly occur. Still, any or a combination of these sounds isn't a death sentence just yet, but they are a cause for concern.

Access your **[Noisy hard drive](https://github.com/computers0lution/Noisy-hard-drive)**  as soon as possible and perform a thorough backup of all your data, either online or to an alternative storage unit or hard drive. Any troubleshooting can wait until after you make sure your data is safe somewhere else.

One of those noises was dubbed **"the click of death"** back in the 1990s and is a sign of catastrophic hard drive failure. You may be familiar with it if you've used an old computer where it's a series of loud clicks followed by a short "beep." If you're not sure which sounds or normal and which aren't, DataCent has a library of various hard drives and their failing sounds.

## What should I do for a **Noisy hard drive** ?

* If the ## What should I do for a **[Noisy hard drive](https://github.com/computers0lution/Noisy-hard-drive)** ?
  is also not detected, please use one of our external drive troubleshooters to try to get it detected.
* Remove the drive from any USB hub in which it may be connected.  Connect it directly into the USB port.
* Try connecting the drive in different USB ports on your computer.  It may not beep when connected via a different USB port.
* If you are using a desktop computer, connect the drive to a USB port on the rear of the computer.
* Replace the USB cable with a new or known-good cable.
* Some USB-only drives connect via a **"Y-cable"**, such as that seen in Document ID: 205479. Connect the drive using both plugs of the Y-cable to provide maximum power.
* If you are attempting to use an eSATA connection with a GoFlex drive, make sure it is a powered eSATA port.  See Document ID: 214371 for more information.
* If beeping persists, connect the drive to another computer to see if the beeping follows the ## What should I do for a **[Noisy hard drive](https://github.com/computers0lution/Noisy-hard-drive)** ?
. 
* If the drive functions well on a different computer, then the original machine is not providing enough power to operate your drive.  A powered USB hub may help.
